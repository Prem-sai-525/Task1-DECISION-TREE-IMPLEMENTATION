 **Overview of the Decision Tree Implementation**

 Objective:
To implement a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. This project demonstrates the core working principles of decision trees, particularly using the ID3 algorithm which is based on Information Gain.

 Core Components:
1. Data Handling
The dataset is read from a CSV file.

Data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets manually.

The data is assumed to be suitable for classification tasks (usually categorical or binary).

2. Entropy and Information Gain
A custom function calculates the entropy of the dataset:

𝐸
𝑛
𝑡
𝑟
𝑜
𝑝
𝑦
(
𝑆
)
=

∑

(
𝑝

)
Entropy(S)=−∑p 
i
​

​
 (p

​
 )
Another function computes the Information Gain for each attribute to determine the best feature for splitting.

This is the heart of how the tree decides what to split on at each node.

3. Decision Tree Construction
A recursive function builds the decision tree using the feature with the highest information gain at each step.

The decision tree is stored as a nested dictionary, where:

Keys are feature names

Values are branches with further splits or leaf labels

4. Prediction
A function recursively traverses the decision tree based on feature values in the test sample.

Returns the predicted label (class).

5. Model Evaluation
Predictions are made on the test dataset.

Accuracy is calculated as:

Accuracy

Provides a basic evaluation metric to assess performance.

 Implementation Details
No external ML libraries used.

Logic closely follows the ID3 algorithm.

Focus is on understanding decision trees conceptually and programmatically.

The structure and flow are educational and transparent, ideal for learning.

 Dataset
The dataset is expected to be a CSV file with categorical or binary features.

Labels are binary (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1).
